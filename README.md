# ENGR100: Autonomous Drones (Maze Navigation and Mapping)

For Ardupilot's source code, see https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot.

This repo contains the code for my ENGR 100 final project. My team wrote code to autonomously navigate a drone through a maze, and map the maze from log files collected during the flight. My contribution to this project was the mapping. To see the code for the mapping, view the [mapping](https://github.com/siuryan/engr100-mapping/tree/master/mapping) directory.
